                <p>- Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, The Sorrows of Young Werther</p>
                <p>--------------------</p>

                <p>In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.</p>
                <p>- Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice</p>

                <p>I have for the first time found what I can truly love - I have found you. You are my sympathy - my better self - my good angel; I am bound to you with a strong attachment. I think you good, gifted, lovely: a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you, draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence about you - and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.</p>

                <p>The beginning of love is the will to let those we love be perfectly themselves, the resolution not to twist them to fit our own image.</p>

                <p>--------------------</p>
                <p>A.F. Day: 33</p>
                <p>What I Have Lived For</p>
                <p>Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a great ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair.
</p>
                <p>I have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy - ecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all the rest of life for a few hours of this joy. I have sought it, next, because it relieves loneliness - that terrible loneliness in which one shivering consciousness looks over the rim of the world into the cold unfathomable lifeless abyss. I have sought it finally, because in the union of love I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring vision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined. This is what I sought, and though it might seem too good for human life, this is what - at last - I have found.
</p>
                <p>With equal passion I have sought knowledge. I have wished to understand the hearts of men. I have wished to know why the stars shine. And I have tried to apprehend the Pythagorean power by which number holds sway above the flux. A little of this, but not much, I have achieved.        
</p>
                <p>Love and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward the heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth. Echoes of cries of pain reverberate in my heart. Children in famine, victims tortured by oppressors, helpless old people a burden to their sons, and the whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery of what human life should be. I long to alleviate this evil, but I cannot, and I too suffer.
</p>
                <p>This has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would gladly live it again if the chance were offered me.

                <p>A.F. Day: 34</p>
                <p>To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one... The only place outside of Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers of love is Hell.

                <p>How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.<br>I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
<br>My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
<br>For the ends of being and ideal grace.
<br>I love thee to the level of every day's
<br>Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.
<br>I love thee freely, as men strive for right.
<br>I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.
<br>I love thee with the passion put to use
<br>In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
<br>I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
<br>With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,
<br>Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,
<br>I shall but love thee better after death.

                <p>Let me not to the marriage of true minds<br>Admit impediments. Love is not love
<br>Which alters when it alteration finds,
<br>Or bends with the remover to remove.
</p>
                <p>O no! it is an ever-fixed mark<br>That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
<br>It is the star to every wand'ring bark,
<br>Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
</p>
                <p>Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks<br>Within his bending sickle's compass come:
<br>Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
<br>But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
</p>
                <p>If this be error and upon me proved,<br>I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
</p>
                <p>- Shakespeare, Sonnet 118

<br>The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
<br>Of night and light and the half light,
<br>I would spread the cloths under your feet:
<br>But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
<br>I have spread my dreams under your feet;
<br>Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.
