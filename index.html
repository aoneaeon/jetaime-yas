                        <p>Bonjour, my name is Alexander Collin P. Mc Innis. I'm 18 and enrolled in the CS-O program. I live in Calatagan, Batangas, and graduated from Victory Christian International School in the STEM track.</p>
                        <p>My relationship with maths is one of reverence. No other humanly-constructed discipline rivals mathematics in its degree of abstractness, generalizability, universality, immutability, timelessness, structural invariance, infinite scope, aesthetic austerity, and self-referential coherence and tautological consistency. It's the ur-language of cognition as well as the skeletal backbone of reality; it's isomorphic to the syntactic structures that govern reality at both physical and metaphysical strata: a pattern-system that encompasses the real and imagined, the visual and mental, the static and dynamic, the qualitative and quantitative, and the utilitarian and recreational. </p>
                        <p>I look forward to this and subsequent mathematics courses in deepening my understanding and broadening my appreciation for this extraordinary field. Maths is divine.</p>

                    <div class="db">
                        <p>I am Yasmine Fortifaes. I am enrolled in the CpE-O program under the School of Electrical, Electronics, and Computer Engineering. I am currently located in Metro Manila. I accomplished my senior high school education in Guagua National Colleges Inc. under the academic track of STEM with consistent honors, despite my outspoken disinterest towards the K-12 curricula.</p>
                        <p>In lieu, I favored my eclectical range of interests as I have a higher propensity for autodidactism; I took an active interest in how computers work—from the ground up. I began with Python and C++ a few years ago, but I preferred the latter despite it being discouraged for beginners because of the verbose syntax and the considerable learning curve, but I personally favored the conscientiousness it requires.</p>
                        <p>I would occasionally code programs to aid in my other shenanigans, like a certain math quiz program I wrote before and used daily. Eventually, I plan to major in Cybersecurity, as it requires the framework I need for Computer Mastery; requiring proficiency in not only one—but all aspects of the Computer: Hardware, Software, and Networking. Computers are literally just mathematical machines; elaborate and extremely sophisticated calculators—calculating your social media, videogames, and everything in the digital world.</p>
                        <p>Personally, I find mathematics absolutely magneficent. After all, it is the absolute and omnipresent axiom that's able to tame and organize the chaos of the universe—singlehandedly used to quantify the previously unquantifiable and predict the previously unpredictable...</p>
                        <p>Just how wonderful of a privilege is it to take upon the present culmination of that as an intellectual pursuit? all in courtesy of the historical trailblazers who contributed groundbreaking discoveries that now constitute Math to the B R O A D field that it is today? Just take a small glimpse of the encyclopedias, and behold, the harmony of the most brilliant minds; in different timelines, different origins, and different realities, yet all under the commonality of the great Mathematics...</p>
                        <p>Which is the sole reason I strive to learn it, and I am grateful for being comfortable enough in learning it—as I have always been able to ace math tests since I was a kid with minimal to no studying. Though, I can't claim to be extrordinary at it, as those were simply surface-level and tip of the profoundly deep iceberg that mathematics is. So much more goes beyond that—that a single lifetime or two will not be able to cover, no matter the intellectual caliber of the human—it is just THAT much, and its magnitude only proceeds to evolve.</p>
